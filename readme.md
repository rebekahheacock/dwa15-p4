# P4 for DWA15: Summiteer

## Description

Summitteer is a hiking log for those attempting to join the AMC 4000 Footer Club by hiking all 48 of the 4000-foot peaks in New Hampshire’s White Mountains. Summiteer allows users to track which peaks they’ve climbed and when, mileage, and notes (on things like gear, companions, trail(s) used, weather, and trail conditions). 

Hikes can be logged publicly (in which case, they'll show up on the page for an individual peak; the 10 most recent public hikes are listed on the home page) or privately (in which case, they're only viewable by the user who logged them).


## Features
- Log in with either username or email address.
- Random personalized welcome message each time a user logs in.
- Custom error messages.
- Sortable table of peaks in the White Mountains, with links to peak descriptions and summit forecasts.
- Hikes can be logged publicly or privately.
- Display of 10 most recent public hikes on home page.
- All publicly logged hikes are displayed on an individual peak's page.
- User progress displayed as number (5 peaks) and progress bar.

## Notes

- Users can log in using either their username or their email address. For DWA15 purposes, usernames for the standard users are "jillharvard" and "jamalharvard."
