		<h1>Welcome to Summiteer</h1>
		<p>Summitteer helps you log your hikes as you work toward joining the <a href="http://www.amc4000footer.org/">AMC 4000 Footer Club</a> by hiking all 48 of the <a href="/peaks">4000-foot peaks</a> in New Hampshireâ€™s White Mountains. Summiteer helps you track which peaks you've climbed and when, mileage, and notes (on things like gear, companions, trail(s) used, weather, and trail conditions).</p>

		<p>You can log hikes publicly (in which case, they'll show up on the page for an individual peak; the 10 most recent public hikes are listed on the home page) or privately (in which case, they're only viewable by you).</p>

		<p>Read enough? <a href="{{ Auth::check() ? '/log' : '/login' }}">Start tracking.</a>
