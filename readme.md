# P4 for DWA15: Summiteer

## Description

Summitteer is a hiking log for those attempting to join the AMC 4000 Footer Club by hiking all 48 of the 4000-foot peaks in New Hampshire’s White Mountains. Summiteer allows users to track which peaks they’ve climbed and when, mileage, and notes (on things like gear, companions, trail(s) used, weather, and trail conditions). 

## Notes

- Users can log in using either their username or their email address. For DWA15 purposes, usernames for the standard users are "jillharvard" and "jamalharvard."
